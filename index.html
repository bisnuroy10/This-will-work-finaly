  <h4>Now explain the journey how diffult it was to create a git repo:</h4>
  <p>Actually this is first time so it was a terrible thing to me.At first I create a repo I published it without adding config git global user name and email address.Then I fix it.Up next I forgot to add my git with my github account.Then I watched yesterday's tutorial And add my git with my github.Now, it is working smmothly.And I am so happy now.</p>
